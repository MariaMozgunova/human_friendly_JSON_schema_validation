### Human friendly JSON schema validation
This program validates JSON files and schemas for them. In case of success, JSON file validates against JSON schema. JSON schemas and JSON files should be in different directories. Errors during validation are logged to the logs.txt. The user chooses dirs to work with with graphical interface provided by `tkinter.filedialog.askdirectory`.

### Motivation
All the errors are logged in the user friendly way, so that nonprogammer could fix the bug.

### Code Example
Show what the library does as concisely as possible, developers should be able to figure out how your project solves their problem by looking at the code example. Make sure the API you are showing off is obvious, and that your code is short and concise.

### Installation
Provide step by step series of examples and explanations about how to get a development env running.
